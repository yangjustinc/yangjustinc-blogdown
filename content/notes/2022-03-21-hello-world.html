<p>Hello! Welcome to my new personal academic landing page. Having previously tried <a href="https://academic-demo.netlify.app">Hugo Academic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a>, both of which were very nice, I found that updating themes was annoying and bothersome sometimes, often requiring me to sit down and rebase/merge differences across code where I modified themes for my taste and purpose.</p>
<p>So now it’s back to basics with Yihui Xie’s marvelous great <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin">XMin</a> theme where I can focus entirely on content and not have to worry too much about theming and visuals and such. It’s not necessarily “pretty” but I think there is also an elegance to simplicity.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to use this site more robustly to share my thoughts, random things I come across in my work, and maybe other things if they are of interest.</p>
