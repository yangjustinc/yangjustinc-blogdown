# Justin C Yang

I'm a psychiatric epidemiologist in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I'm also the [research database](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database) manager at [Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.candi.nhs.uk) and an honorary lecturer in the [Wolfson Institute of Population Health](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph) at [Queen Mary, University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). 

Working primarily in <i class="fa-brands fa-r-project" title="R"></i> and <i class="fa-brands fa-python" title="Python"></i>, I analyse electronic health records using epidemiological, causal inference, and machine learning methods to understand patients accessing secondary mental health services, their care, and their health outcomes. Iâ€™m broadly interested in applying administrative and routinely collected data to ameliorate health disparities, pharmacotherapy, and outcomes for individuals living with serious mental conditions, including psychosis and substance use disorders.

I received my PhD in Public Health and Primary Care from [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Professor Carol Brayne](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/visitors/professor-carol-brayne-cbe) and [Dr. Andres Roman-Urrestarazu](https://arc-eoe.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/people/researchers/andres-roman-urrestarazu). Before that, I received my MSPH in Health Policy from the [Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), and my BA and BSc from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca).

Previously, I have held roles in healthcare strategy consulting, higher education administration, and nonprofit management. When I'm not working, I enjoy travelling, theatre, art house cinema, reading, and tabletop gaming.
