# Justin C Yang 

I'm an epidemiologist and data scientist working in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). My work tries to understand how we can better support people living with mental health conditions by making sense of large, messy datasets.

Currently, I'm an [Administrative Data Research UK](https://www.adruk.org) research fellow and manage the research database at [North London NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.northlondonmentalhealth.nhs.uk). I'm also affiliated with the [Mental Health Policy and Economics Group](https://www.mentalhealthpolicyeconomicsgroup.com) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk).

Most of my work involves digging into routinely collected data to spot patterns that might help improve care. I'm particularly interested in how factors like where people live, what services they can access, and their broader social circumstances affect mental health outcomes.

Right now, I'm leading a [project](https://www.adruk.org/news-publications/news-blogs/linking-data-to-improve-outcomes-for-neurodivergent-young-people) using the [Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data](https://www.echild.ac.uk) to better understand what puts neurodivergent young people at risk for poor outcomes. The goal is to provide evidence that can actually inform how we support these children and their families, something that feels increasingly urgent given the challenges facing young people today.

I did my PhD at Cambridge ([Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk)) working with Carol Brayne and Andres Roman-Urrestarazu, my MSPH at [Johns Hopkins](https://www.jhu.edu) ([Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu)), and my undergraduate degrees at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca).

My research interests span the social determinants of mental health, spatial epidemiology, causal inference methods, and pharmacoepidemiology. I'm also interested in ecological momentary assessment, data linkage methods, and finding ways to make research more open and collaborative.
