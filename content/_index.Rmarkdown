# Justin C Yang, PhD
I'm currently a Research Fellow under the supervision of [David Osborn](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry/people/david-osborn) in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I'm also an Honorary Research Associate at [Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.candi.nhs.uk) (where I manage its [Research Database](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database)) and an Honorary Lecturer in the [Wolfson Institute of Population Health](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph) at [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).

My current research involves the analysis of electronic health records to examine outcomes in those accessing secondary mental health services. I’m broadly interested in the epidemiological applications of administrative and routinely collected data with a particular interest in mental health and health disparities. I’ve also been leading the linkage of complementary datasets to enable further research at Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust as well as the application of machine learning techniques to annotate and study patterns in patient records, including natural language processing of clinical free-text. I mainly work in (mostly tidy) R, SQL, Python, GIS, Bash, and Stata. 

My [doctoral dissertation](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/296192) elucidated the socioeconomic correlates of substance use disorders and disparities in their treatment in the contexts of the 2008 global financial crisis and the second and third waves of opioid overdose deaths in 2010 and 2013, supervised by [Carol Brayne](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/visitors/professor-carol-brayne-cbe) and [Andres Roman-Urrestarazu](https://arc-eoe.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/people/researchers/andres-roman-urrestarazu) at [Wolfson College](https://wolfson.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). Before starting my PhD, I completed a master’s degree at [JHSPH](https://publichealth.jhu.edu) and undergraduate studies at the [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca) where I completed my [graduating essay](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/44125) under the supervision of [Scott MacKenzie](https://english.olemiss.edu/scott-r-mackenzie) on the ways in which the invention and dissemination of the pendulum clock in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries facilitated new phenomenological experiences of reckoning the passing of time which were fundamental to the concomitant emergence and rise of the novel. 

When I'm not working, I'm usually reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4912476-justin) and comics, [traveling](https://instagram.com/yangjustinc), watching too many [TV shows and films](https://trakt.tv/users/yangjustinc), attending the theatre, or playing board games and tabletop RPGs.
