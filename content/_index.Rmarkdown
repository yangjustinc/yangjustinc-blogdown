# Justin C Yang

I'm a psychiatric epidemiologist in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I'm also the [research database](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database) manager at [Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.candi.nhs.uk) and an honorary lecturer in the [Wolfson Institute of Population Health](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph) at [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).

Working primarily in <i class="fa-brands fa-r-project" title="R"></i> and <i class="fa-brands fa-python" title="Python"></i>, I analyse electronic health records using epidemiological, causal inference, and machine learning methods to understand patients accessing secondary mental health services, their care, and their health outcomes. Iâ€™m broadly interested in applying administrative and routinely collected data to ameliorate health disparities, pharmacotherapy, and outcomes for individuals living with mental conditions.

Previously, I have held various roles in healthcare strategy consulting, higher education administration, and nonprofit management. When I'm not working, I enjoy travelling, theatre, art house cinema, reading, and tabletop gaming. 

## Research Interests
- Social and economic determinants of mental health
- Spatial and environmental epidemiology
- Pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacovigilance
- Causal inference in behavioural health
- Mental health equity and justice
