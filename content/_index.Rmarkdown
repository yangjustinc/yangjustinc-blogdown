# Justin C Yang 

I'm a Senior Research Fellow in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), where I also manage the research database at [North London NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.northlondonmentalhealth.nhs.uk). My funders include [Administrative Data Research UK](https://www.adruk.org), the [UKRI Mental Health Platform](https://www.mentalhealthplatform.ac.uk), and the [National Institute for Health and Care Research](https://www.nihr.ac.uk). 

I specialise in causal inference, natural language processing/large language models, and spatial analysis applied to mental health research. My work involves the transformation and combination of large, complex, and multimodal datasets into actionable insights that lead to better care and outcomes for people with a range of mental health needs, including severe and enduring mental illness, neurodevelopmental conditions, and substance use disorders. For instance, Iâ€™m leading a [project](https://www.adruk.org/news-publications/news-blogs/linking-data-to-improve-outcomes-for-neurodivergent-young-people) using [Education and Child Health Insights from Linked Data](https://www.echild.ac.uk/) to better understand what puts neurodivergent young people at risk for poor outcomes. Working globally across the public, private, and third/voluntary sectors, I generate insights that shape how we think about and treat mental health conditions. 

I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge ([Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk)) under the supervision of Professor Carol Brayne and Dr Andres Roman-Urrestarazu. I earned my MSPH from [Johns Hopkins](https://www.jhu.edu) [Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu) and my undergraduate degrees from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca). My professional experience includes two decades in higher education administration, non-profit management, and strategy consultancy. 

My research interests span the spectrum of social and spatial determinants of mental health, advanced research methods, and applied health and social care research. I'm committed to open science, equitable and diverse research inclusion and engagement, and participatory research co-production. I'm open to being contacted by fellow researchers, policy makers and practitioners, and anyone interested in my work more generallly. Feel free to  [reach out](/contact)!
