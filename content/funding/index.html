Matchmaking and Mentoring: An Experimental Study of Online Entrepreneurial Support
</h2>
</a><em>Funded by Innovation Growth Lab (Kauffman Foundation, Argidius Foundation &amp; NESTA) for USD 201359 from 2018 to 2020</em>
<p />
How do entrepreneurs connect with mentors online, and what strategies can help them find an appropriate mentor? What are the impacts of online mentoring on entrepreneurial performance? Despite the fact that mentoring is generally considered useful, we know very little about how entrepreneurs actually find their mentors, and whether they have an impact on entrepreneurial performance. <a href = "https://www.asaecenter.org/about-us/news_releases/2017/march/asae-foundation-announces-two-association-management-grants">
<h2>
The Role of Associations and Intermediaries in Shaping and Legitimizing New Organizational Fields: Social Enterprise in India
</h2>
</a><em>Funded by ASAE Foundation for USD 7389 from 2017 to 2019</em>
<p />
<p>This research project aims to examine the role of associations and intermediary organizations in influencing the growth of the social enterprise sector in India. The proposed study, which forms the first stage of a larger cross-country collaborative effort, will draw on theoretical frameworks developed by Kerlin (2006; 2009) and Nicholls (2010) to examine how associations of social enterprises and organizations that support social enterprises emerged in India over the past decade, and how they contributed to the growth of the field.</p>
