<h2>
The acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Enhanced Patient Observation in reducing the risk of self-harm and suicide on psychiatric wards
</h2>
<p></a><em>Funded by National Institute for Health Research for GBP 1,519,760 from December 2024 to November 2027</em><br />Research questions Is Enhanced Patient Observation (EPO) acceptable to psychiatric inpatients and ward staff? Is it used differentially for specific patient groups? Is EPO effective and cost-effective in reducing risk of self-harm (SH) and suicide during psychiatric admission? Could EPO be improved? Background EPO of patients by staff is used widely on psychiatric inpatient wards in England, consuming significant resources. Although recommended in NICE guidelines there is no good evidence it reduces the risk of suicide and SH. Qualitative evidence and our patient/staff consultation shows that patients can find it intrusive, coercive and unsettling. Newer methods of analysing observational data can overcome the cost and time implications of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and have equivalent validity to RCT findings, yet have not been applied to this context. Aims and objectives Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EPO for suicide and SH, establish its acceptability and explore suggestions for change. Our objectives are: to collect quantitative (cost/activity) data on the practice of EPO on general adult psychiatric wards in England, and qualitative data on its acceptability to patients, carers and ward staff; to analyse routine clinical data to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EPO in reducing suicide/SH; to bring this evidence together to co-produce staff training, patient information, revisions to clinical guidelines, and policy advice to improve the safety and experiences of staff and inpatients. Methods We will collect EPO cost/practice data for all general adult NHS psychiatric units in England, for use in our CEA. We will conduct individual qualitative interviews with current inpatients and clinical staff nationally with experience of EPO to explore their experiences and potential suggestions for change. Using electronic health records (EHRs) for two mental health trusts, we will develop an algorithm that can identify patients on EPO (and indication) for each bed day and describe their characteristics. We will test whether neurodivergent patients and those from ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to be placed on EPO. Using a target trial emulation approach we will analyse EHR data in two trusts to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EPO in reducing risk of SH and suicide on psychiatric wards. Bringing all this evidence together in a set of separate workshops for inpatients and ward staff, we will start a process of co-creating training, patient information, and policy briefings, and suggesting revisions to local/national clinical guidelines to improve EPOâ€™s therapeutic value. Timelines for delivery In Y1 and Y2 we will collect and analyse national cost/activity/qualitative data and create our algorithm. In Y2 and Y3 we will model target trial emulation. In Y3 workshops we will discuss findings to create staff training, patient information, policy briefings, and suggested revisions to clinical guidelines, using diverse methods of dissemination to reach all stakeholders. Anticipated impact and dissemination Our close working with clinical leaders and commissioners will ensure that the staff training package we create will be integrated into existing training infrastructures. This, and our wider dissemination of findings, will ensure that the evidence we create will translate rapidly into benefits to patients, staff and all stakeholders.</p>

<h2>
Health-related outcomes, alternative provision, and exclusion among pupils with neurodivergent special educational needs
</h2>
<p></a><em>Funded by Economic and Social Research Council for GBP 199,660.5 from October 2024 to March 2026</em><br />Special educational needs (SEN) refer to learning difficulties or disabilities which can make it harder for a child or young person to learn compared with other pupils of the same age. Types of SEN can vary widely, including difficulties with communication and interaction, cognitive and learning difficulty, and other social, emotional, and mental health problems. Some of these SEN can be considered in terms of neurodiversity or neurodivergence which describe a person whose brain functions, ways of processing information, and/or behaviours are considered atypical.
Pupils with neurodivergent SEN may receive support from school and/or local authorities yet health and educational outcomes are often worse for these pupils nevertheless. For example, pupils with neurodivergent SEN are more likely to have medically-related absences from school, engage in self-harm, and die by suicide. As well, pupils with neurodivergent SEN are more often subject to formal school exclusion and attend alternative provision. These adverse experiences and outcomes in childhood and adolescence can lead to lifelong disparities in employment, socioeconomic status, and well-being.
Identifying and understanding which risk factors are associated with adverse outcomes can be an important step in designing targeted interventions to support pupils with neurodivergent SEN to succeed in school and in life. For instance, school-based SEN support for neurodivergence can be a crucial factor but not enough is known about how differential SEN support might be causally related to specific outcomes for distinct types of neurodivergent SEN. SEN provision is meant to account for individual needs but can be very heterogeneous in practice. As well, evidence about disparities in who receives support from local authorities through Education, Health, and Care Plans (EHCPs) and how EHCPs may be linked to long-term outcomes can help guide policymaking to improve EHCP provision.
This fellowship proposal aims to apply descriptive epidemiology, data science, and causal inference in several work packages to explore these questions using observational data from The Education and Child Insights from Linked Data (ECHILD) database. Descriptive epidemiological approaches will be used to explore relationships between educational and health risk factors and outcomes among secondary school pupils with neurodivergent SEN, including building on existing work examining empirical phenotypes of neurodivergent SEN. These work packages will make use of advanced statistical models which will account for hierarchical, longitudinal, and time-varying data. Another work package will investigate the feasibility of applying causal inference approaches in ECHILD with a proposed target trial emulation. Finally, this work will examine spatial patterns and disparities in adverse outcomes among pupils with neurodivergent SEN.</p>
