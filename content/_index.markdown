# Justin C Yang, PhD
I'm a research fellow under the supervision of [David Osborn](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry/people/david-osborn) in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I'm also the [research database](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database) manager at [Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.candi.nhs.uk) (C&I) and an honorary lecturer in the [Wolfson Institute of Population Health](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph) at [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).

I analyse electronic health records to better understand patients accessing secondary mental health services. I’m interested in the epidemiological applications of administrative and routinely collected data, especially to understand mental health and health disparities. I am leading the linkage of complementary datasets to the C&I research database as well as the application of machine learning to annotate patient records, including natural language processing of clinical free-text. I mainly work in (mostly tidy) R, SQL, Python, GIS, Bash, and Stata. 

My [doctoral work](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/296192) at [Wolfson College](https://wolfson.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), examined the socioeconomic correlates of substance use disorders and disparities in their treatment in the United States and was supervised by [Carol Brayne](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/visitors/professor-carol-brayne-cbe) and [Andres Roman-Urrestarazu](https://arc-eoe.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/people/researchers/andres-roman-urrestarazu). I completed a master’s degree at [JHSPH](https://publichealth.jhu.edu) and undergraduate studies at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca) where I completed my [graduating essay](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/44125) under the supervision of [Scott MacKenzie](https://english.olemiss.edu/scott-r-mackenzie) on the ways in which advancements in clock technology facilitated new phenomenological experiences of temporality which were fundamental to the concomitant rise of the novel during the long eighteenth century. 

When I'm not working, I'm usually reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4912476-justin) and [comics](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/yangjustinc), [traveling](https://instagram.com/yangjustinc), watching too many [TV shows and films](https://trakt.tv/users/yangjustinc), or playing [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/yangjustinc) and [tabletop RPGs](https://app.roll20.net/users/2158343/justin).
