# Justin C Yang 

I am a health data scientist and psychiatric epidemiologist in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I am also the [research database](https://www.northlondonmentalhealth.nhs.uk/ci-research-database-) manager at [North London NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.northlondonmentalhealth.nhs.uk), an affiliated researcher with the [Mental Health|Policy|Economics Group](https://www.mentalhealthpolicyeconomicsgroup.com) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), and a visiting lecturer in the [Wolfson Intitute of Population Health](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph) at [Queen Mary, University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). 

I analyse routinely collected and adminstrative data using epidemiological, causal inference, and geospatial methods to understand the care and outcomes of people living with long-term mental health conditions. I am broadly interested in using health and social care data to ameliorate health disparities, care, and outcomes for people living with conditions such as severe mental illness, substance use disorders, and neurodevelopmental problems. I hold professional memberships with the [Society for Epidemiologic Research](https://epiresearch.org), the [Society for the Study of Addiction](https://www.addiction-ssa.org), and the [International College of Neuropsychopharmacology](https://cinp.org).

I received my PhD in Public Health and Primary Care from [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), under the supervision of Professor Carol Brayne and Dr. Andres Roman-Urrestarazu. Before that, I worked at [Avalere](https://avalere.com), a health care consultancy based in Washington, DC, where I worked with clients from life sciences, charitable foundations, and patient groups. I received my MSPH from the [Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), and my BA Hons and BSc from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca).
