# Justin C Yang, PhD
I'm a psychiatric epidemiologist supervised by [David Osborn](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry/people/david-osborn) in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I'm also the [research database](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database) manager at [Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.candi.nhs.uk) (C&I)[^cris] and an honorary lecturer in the [Wolfson Institute of Population Health](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph) at [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).

[^cris]:In this role, I help researchers and clinicians access and make use of anonymised patient health records at C&I as well as use it myself for research. I offer guidance on study feasibility and design, conduct data extraction, and review outputs. If you're interested, you can learn more [here](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database/researchers-and-clinicians), including how to apply for access.

I analyse electronic health records to better understand patients accessing secondary mental health services and their care.[^example] I’m interested in the epidemiological applications of administrative and routinely collected data, especially to understand health disparities and mental health. I am leading the linkage of complementary datasets to the C&I research database[^linkage] as well as the application of machine learning to annotate patient records, including natural language processing of clinical free-text. I mainly work in (mostly tidy) R, SQL, Python, GIS, Bash, and Stata. 

[^example]:[Here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.28.21266870)'s an example of work I've done using the research database, but I have a number of other papers/analyses in progress as well. Feel free to reach out if you're curious! 

[^linkage]:I'm currently working on applications to link data from [Hospital Episode Statistics](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics) (HES), [linked HES-ONS mortality data](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/linked-hes-ons-mortality-data), and the [National Cancer Registry](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-cancer-registration-and-analysis-service-ncras).

My [doctoral training](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/296192) at [Wolfson College](https://wolfson.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), examined the socioeconomic correlates of substance use disorders and disparities in their treatment in the United States and was supervised by [Carol Brayne](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/visitors/professor-carol-brayne-cbe) and [Andres Roman-Urrestarazu](https://arc-eoe.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/people/researchers/andres-roman-urrestarazu). I completed a master’s degree at [JHSPH](https://publichealth.jhu.edu) and undergraduate studies at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca) where I completed my [graduating essay](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/44125) under the supervision of [Scott MacKenzie](https://english.olemiss.edu/scott-r-mackenzie) on the ways in which advancements in clock technology facilitated new phenomenological experiences of time which were fundamental to the concomitant "rise of the novel" during the long eighteenth century.

When I'm not working, I'm usually reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4912476-justin) and [comics](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/yangjustinc), [traveling](https://instagram.com/yangjustinc), watching too many [TV shows and films](https://trakt.tv/users/yangjustinc), or playing [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/yangjustinc) and [tabletop RPGs](https://app.roll20.net/users/2158343/justin).
