# Justin C Yang

Hello! I am a psychiatric epidemiologist and mental health researcher in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I am also the [research database](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database) manager at [Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.candi.nhs.uk) and an honorary lecturer in the [Wolfson Institute of Population Health](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph) at [Queen Mary, University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). 

I analyse electronic health records and other  using epidemiological, causal inference, and machine learning methods to understand the care and outcomes of patients accessing mental health services. Iâ€™m interested in applying administrative and routinely collected data to ameliorate health disparities, care, and outcomes for individuals living with serious mental conditions, including psychosis and substance use disorders. I hold professional memberships with the [Society for Epidemiologic Research](https://epiresearch.org) and the [Society for the Study of Addiction](https://www.addiction-ssa.org).

I received my PhD in Public Health and Primary Care from [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), under the supervision of Professor Carol Brayne and Dr. Andres Roman-Urrestarazu. Before that, I received my MSPH in Health Policy from the [Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu), and my BA Hons (English) and BSc (Cell Biology & Genetics) from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca).
