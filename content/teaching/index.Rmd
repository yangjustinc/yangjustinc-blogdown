## Teaching
I primarily teach epidemiology, statistics, and open science at the postgraduate level. I teach on the Core Principles of Mental Health Research and Practical Statistics for Mental Health Research modules at UCL. More recently, I have co-developed curricula around open science and public involvement and engagement with research.

## Supervision
```{r results = 'asis',echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

read_csv('students.csv') |> 
  arrange(desc(`Year(s)`), Student) |> 
  knitr::kable() |> 
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)
```
