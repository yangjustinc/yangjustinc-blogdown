## Teaching
I am a guest lecturer on the [Core Principles of Mental Health Research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/core-principles-of-mental-health-research-PSBS0002) module at UCL. I have previously taught on statistics and epidemiology modules at the postgraduate level. 

## Supervision
```{r results = 'asis',echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

read_csv('students.csv') |> 
  arrange(desc(`Year(s)`), Student) |> 
  knitr::kable() |> 
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)
```
