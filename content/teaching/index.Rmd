## University College London
I'm a teaching assistant for [Practical Statistics for Mental Health Research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/practical-statistics-for-mental-health-research/PSBS0008). I co-supervise MSc students completing their dissertations using the [Research Database at Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database).  

## Queen Mary University of London
I'm a dissertation supervisor on the [MSc in Global Public Health and Policy](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/global-public-health-and-policy-msc) course where I mainly supervise projects pertaining to secondary data analysis, substance use disorders, and comparative health policy. I normally supervise 1-2 students per term.
