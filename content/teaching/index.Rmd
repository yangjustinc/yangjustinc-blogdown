## Teaching
I'm a teaching assistant on the UCL [Practical Statistics for Mental Health Research](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/practical-statistics-for-mental-health-research/PSBS0008) module. 


## Supervision
I co-supervise MSc students at UCL completing their dissertations using the [Research Database at Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database). I'm also a dissertation supervisor on the QMUL [MSc in Global Public Health and Policy](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/global-public-health-and-policy-msc) course where I mainly supervise projects pertaining to secondary data analysis, substance use disorders, and comparative health policy.
