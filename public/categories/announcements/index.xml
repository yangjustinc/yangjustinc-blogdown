      <description>Hello! Welcome to my new personal academic landing page. Having previously tried Hugo Academic and al-folio, both of which were very nice, I found that updating themes was annoying and bothersome sometimes, often requiring me to sit down and rebase/merge differences across code where I modified themes for my taste and purpose.
So now it’s back to basics with Yihui Xie’s marvelous great XMin theme where I can focus entirely on content and not have to worry too much about theming and visuals and such.</description>
