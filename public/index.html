<p>I&rsquo;m currently a Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry">Division of Psychiatry</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>. I&rsquo;m also an Honorary Research Associate at <a href="https://www.candi.nhs.uk">Camden &amp; Islington NHS Foundation Trust</a> (where I am also the <a href="https://www.candi.nhs.uk/health-professionals/research/ci-research-database">Research Database</a> Manager) and an Honorary Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/wiph">Wolfson Institute of Population Health</a> at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk">Queen Mary University of London</a>.</p>
<p>My current research involves the analysis of electronic health records to examine outcomes in those accessing secondary mental health services in the London boroughs of Camden and Islington. I’m broadly interested in the epidemiological applications of administrative and routinely collected data with a particular interest in mental health. I’ve also been leading the linkage of complementary datasets to enable further research at Camden &amp; Islington NHS Foundation Trust as well as the application of machine learning techniques to annotate and study patterns in patient records.</p>
<p>My doctoral dissertation elucidated the social and economic correlates of substance use disorders and disparities in their treatment in the contexts of the 2008 global financial crisis and the second and third waves of opioid overdose deaths in 2010 and 2013, supervised by Professor Carol Brayne and Dr. Andres Roman-Urrestarazu at <a href="https://wolfson.cam.ac.uk">Wolfson College</a>, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a>. Before starting my PhD, I completed a master’s degree at the <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a> and undergraduate studies at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>.</p>
